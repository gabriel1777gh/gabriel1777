Oh, hi! I am Gabriel! ... but anyway, I created this account on GitHub 
to spread a few things that the programmers might be interested in, and maybe I could even help them!

I'm currently creating a project for a game: "Our Story", well, I recommend that you know it if you don't already know it,
and I'm creating this GitHub to help you, and also for you guys to help me u-u... I want to leave some things more than explained:

- I'm not using GitHub yet. I just created it to be something I will use soon.
- I won't share all my codes, as it would be me sharing my entire project for someone to copy them.
- I intend for this GitHub not to gain so much popularity as it will become something very public and that is not what I want,
so please only share it with a friend of yours if he is interested in programming games as they are only intended for these people.

Thank you very much in advance.
